## How to open/run

Go to the site folder in the file manager, then run __index.php__ file.

There are two ways to run __PHP files__. The preferred way of running PHP files is within a web server like ___Apache___, ___Nginx___, or ___IIS___—this allows you to run PHP scripts from your browser. That’s how all PHP websites work! The other way is to run PHP scripts on the command line, and it doesn't require you to set up a web server.
